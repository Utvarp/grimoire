# Your dashboard
The dashboard is likely the very first thing you will encounter after logging in Útvarp. Depending on your role on the platform, you might see a lot of information, or not. Each of the widgets should be self explanatory in themselves give you an overview on how everything is looking for your station on our systems and if anything needs your attention.

Again, depending on your role, you will see different options in the top navigation bar.

- On the left side of the navigation bar, you will have links to options you have access to.
